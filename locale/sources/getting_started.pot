#: ../../getting_started/documentation.rst:11

msgid "Once you purchase an Odoo Online subscription, you will receive instructions by e-mail on how to activate or create your database. From this email, you can activate your existing Odoo database or create a new one from scratch."

msgstr ""

#: ../../getting_started/documentation.rst:85
msgid "We used to deploy full featured projects within 25 to 250 hours of services, which is much faster than any other ERP vendor on the market. Most projects are completed between 1 and 4 calendar months."
msgstr ""

#: ../../getting_started/documentation.rst:89

msgid "Your internal implementation manager"
msgstr ""

#: ../../getting_started/documentation.rst:96
msgid "We will ask you for a single point of contact within your company work on the project with our project manager. To be efficient, this person must:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../getting_started/documentation.rst:100
msgid "**be available at least 2 full days a week** for the project, otherwise you will slow down the implementation. More is better, the fastest implementations have a full time project manager."
msgstr ""

#: ../../getting_started/documentation.rst:104
msgid "**have authority to take decisions** on their own. Odoo usually transforms all departments of companies for the better. In such a project, you have a lot of decisions to take on small details. If there is too much back and forth between several decision makers, it could potentially seriously slow things down."
msgstr ""

#: ../../getting_started/documentation.rst:110
msgid "**have the leadership** to train and enforce policies at most departments. This person must have the support, or be part, of the top management."

msgid "Integrate 95% of your business, not 100%"
msgstr ""

#: ../../getting_started/documentation.rst:117

msgstr ""

#: ../../getting_started/documentation.rst:121
msgid "Customizations cost you money, are more complex to maintain, add risks to the implementation and can cause issues with upgrades."
msgstr ""

#: ../../getting_started/documentation.rst:124
msgid "Standard Odoo can probably cover 95% of your business. Be flexible on the remaining 5%, otherwise that 5% will cost you twice the original project price. One always underestimates the hidden costs of customization."
msgstr ""

#: ../../getting_started/documentation.rst:129
msgid "**Do it the Odoo way, not yours.** Be flexible, use Odoo the way it was designed. Learn how it works and don't try to replicate the way your old system(s) works."
msgstr ""

#: ../../getting_started/documentation.rst:133
msgid "**The project first, customizations second.** If you really want customizations, phase them in at the end of the project, ideally after going into production. Once a customer starts using Odoo, they usually drop about 60% of their customization requests as they learn to do it the out of the box Odoo way. It is more important to have all your business processes working than customizing a screen to add fields or automate a few e-mails."
msgstr ""

#: ../../getting_started/documentation.rst:141
