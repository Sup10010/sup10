Temporary taxes
===============

Given some circumstances, governments can decide to **apply different tax rates as a temporary
mesure**. Therefore, cuts and raises in the standard tax rates may affect your accounting system.

For example, some governments supported their businesses during the Covid-19 crisis with a
*Coronavirus Legislation*, by cutting temporarily some VAT rates.

You most likely need two taxes operating at the same time for a certain time (e.g., to properly
invoice December and January). It is therefore *highly suggested* to duplicate the taxes rather
than editing the existing ones.

.. tip::
   You might face additional questions, donâ€™t hesitate to contact your account manager if you
   need further assistance.
