Odoo Guidelines
===============

This page introduces the Odoo Coding Guidelines. Those aim to improve the
quality of Odoo Apps code. Indeed proper code improves readability, eases
maintenance, helps debugging, lowers complexity and promotes reliability.
These guidelines should be applied to every new module and to all new development.

.. warning::

    When modifying existing files in **stable version** the original file style
    strictly supersedes any other style guidelines. In other words please never
    modify existing files in order to apply these guidelines. It avoids disrupting
    the revision history of code lines. Diff should be kept minimal. For more
    details, see our `pull request guide <https://odoo.com/submit-pr>`_.

.. warning::

    When modifying existing files in **master (development) version** apply those
    guidelines to existing code only for modified code or if most of the file is
    under revision. In other words modify existing files structure only if it is
    going under major changes. In that case first do a **move** commit then apply
    the changes related to the feature.

Module structure
================

Directories
-----------
A module is organized in important directories. Those contain the business logic;
having a look at them should make you understand the purpose of the module.

- *data/* : demo and data xml
- *models/* : models definition
- *controllers/* : contains controllers (HTTP routes)
- *views/* : contains the views and templates
- *static/* : contains the web assets, separated into *css/, js/, img/, lib/, ...*

Other optional directories compose the module.

- *wizard/* : regroups the transient models (``models.TransientModel``) and their views
- *report/* : contains the printable reports and models based on SQL views. Python objects and XML views are included in this directory
- *tests/* : contains the Python tests

File naming
-----------

File naming is important to quickly find information through all odoo addons.
This section explains how to name files in a standard odoo module. As an
example we use a `plant nursery <https://github.com/tivisse/odoodays-2018/tree/master/plant_nursery>`_ application.
It holds two main models *plant.nursery* and *plant.order*.

Concerning *models*, split the business logic by sets of models belonging to
a same main model. Each set lies in a given file named based on its main model.
If there is only one model, its name is the same as the module name. Each
inherited model should be in its own file to help understanding of impacted
models.

.. code-block:: text

    addons/plant_nursery/
    |-- models/
    |   |-- plant_nursery.py (first main model)
    |   |-- plant_order.py (another main model)
    |   |-- res_partner.py (inherited Odoo model)

Concerning *security* and access rights and rules two main files should be used.
First one is the definition of access rights done in a ``ir.model.access.csv``
file. User groups are defined in ``<module>_groups.xml``. Access rules are
defined in ``<model>_security.xml``.

.. code-block:: text

    addons/plant_nursery/
    |-- security/
    |   |-- ir.model.access.csv
    |   |-- plant_nursery_groups.xml
    |   |-- plant_nursery_security.xml
    |   |-- plant_order_security.xml

Concerning *views*, backend views should be split like models and suffixed
by ``_views.xml``. Backend views are list, form, kanban, activity, graph, pivot, ..
views. In case of large modules specifying a lot of menus, the menus should
be extracted into a separate ``<module>_menus.xml`` file. Templates (QWeb
pages used notably for portal / website display) and bundles (import of JS and
CSS assets) are put in separate files. Those are respectively
``<model>_templates.xml`` and ``assets.xml`` files.

.. code-block:: text

    addons/plant_nursery/
    |-- views/
    |   | -- assets.xml (import of JS / CSS)
    |   | -- plant_nursery_menus.xml (optional definition of main menus)
    |   | -- plant_nursery_views.xml (backend views)
    |   | -- plant_nursery_templates.xml (portal templates)
    |   | -- plant_order_views.xml
    |   | -- plant_order_templates.xml
    |   | -- res_partner_views.xml

Concerning *data*, split them by purpose (demo or data) and main model. Filenames
will be the main_model name suffixed by ``_demo.xml`` or ``_data.xml``. For instance
for an application having demo and data for its main model as well as subtypes,
activities and mail templates all related to mail module:

.. code-block:: text

    addons/plant_nursery/
    |-- data/
    |   |-- plant_nursery_data.xml
    |   |-- plant_nursery_demo.xml
    |   |-- mail_data.xml

Concerning *controllers*, generally all controllers belong to a single controller
contained in a file named ``<module_name>.py``. An old convention in Odoo is to
name this file ``main.py`` but it is considered as outdated. If you need to inherit
an existing controller from another module do it in ``<inherited_module_name>.py``.
For example adding portal controller in an application is done in ``portal.py``.

.. code-block:: text

    addons/plant_nursery/
    |-- controllers/
    |   |-- plant_nursery.py
    |   |-- portal.py (inheriting portal/controllers/portal.py)
    |   |-- main.py (deprecated, replaced by plant_nursery.py)

Concerning *static files*, Javascript files follow globally the same logic as
python models. Each component should be in its own file with a meaningful name.
For instance, the activity widgets are located in ``activity.js`` of mail module.
Subdirectories can also be created to structure the 'package' (see web module
for more details). The same logic should be applied for the templates of JS
widgets (static XML files) and for their styles (scss files). Don't link
data (image, libraries) outside Odoo: do not use an URL to an image but copy
it in the codebase instead.

Concerning *wizards*, naming convention is the same of for python models:
``<transient>.py`` and ``<transient>_views.xml``. Both are put in the wizard
directory. This naming comes from old odoo applications using the wizard
keyword for transient models.

.. code-block:: text

    addons/plant_nursery/
    |-- wizard/
    |   |-- make_plant_order.py
    |   |-- make_plant_order_views.xml

Concerning *statistics reports* done with python / SQL views and classic views
naming is the following :

.. code-block:: text

    addons/plant_nursery/
    |-- report/
    |   |-- plant_order_report.py
    |   |-- plant_order_report_views.xml

Concerning *printable reports* which contain mainly data preparation and Qweb
templates naming is the following :

.. code-block:: text

    addons/plant_nursery/
    |-- report/
    |   |-- plant_order_reports.xml (report actions, paperformat, ...)
    |   |-- plant_order_templates.xml (xml report templates)

The complete tree of our Odoo module therefore looks like

.. note:: File names should only contain ``[a-z0-9_]`` (lowercase
            alphanumerics and ``_``)

.. warning:: Use correct file permissions : folder 755 and file 644.

.. _reference/guidelines/xml:

XML files
=========

Modules (/Applications) data can be imported in Odoo through XML or CSV :ref:`files <reference/data>`.

.. note::

    Data import is faster through CSV files (because records are created in batch).

    If you're creating a lot of records of a given model and the XML features aren't needed,
    CSV import should be priveleged.

Format
------

To declare a record in XML, the **record** notation (using *<record>*) is recommended:

- Place ``id`` attribute before ``model``
- For field declaration, ``name`` attribute is first.
    Then place the *value* either in the ``field`` tag,
    either in the ``ref`` attr for :class:`~odoo.fields.Many2one` fields,
    either in the ``eval`` attribute, and finally place the other attributes
    (widget, options, ...) ordered by importance.
- Try to group the ``record`` declarations by model. In case of dependencies between
    action/menu/views, this convention may not be applicable.
- Use naming conventions defined at the next point.
- The tag *<data>* is only used to set not-updatable data with ``noupdate=1``.
    If there is only not-updatable data in the file, the ``noupdate=1`` can be
    set on the ``<odoo>`` tag, the ``<data>`` tag is unnecessary.

.. code-block:: xml

    <record id="view_id" model="ir.ui.view">
        <field name="name">view.name</field>
        <field name="model">object_name</field>
        <field name="priority" eval="16"/>
        <field name="arch" type="xml">
            <tree>
                <field name="my_field_1"/>
                <field name="my_field_2" string="My Label" widget="statusbar" statusbar_visible="draft,sent,progress,done"/>
            </tree>
        </field>
    </record>

Odoo supports :ref:`custom tags <reference/data/shortcuts>` acting as syntactic sugar:

- ``menuitem``: use it as a shortcut to declare a ``ir.ui.menu``
- ``template``: use it to declare a QWeb View requiring only the ``arch`` section of the view.
- ``report``: use to declare a :ref:`report action <reference/actions/report>`
- ``act_window``: use it if the ``record`` notation can't do what you want (:ref:`window action <reference/actions/window>`)

The 2 first tags are preferred over the *record* notation.

IDs and naming
--------------

.. todo:: actions report naming guidelines ?

Use the following patterns:

* Menus ``<menuitem>|ir.ui.menu``:

    * :samp:`{<module>}_menu_root` for main application menu (in case of application modules).
    * :samp:`{<model_name>}_menu`, or :samp:`{<model_name>}_menu_{do_stuff}` for submenus with/without actions.
* Views ``ir.ui.view``:

    :samp:`{<model_name>}_view_{<view_type>}`, where *view_type* is
    ``kanban``, ``form``, ``tree``, ``search``, ...
* Actions ``ir.actions.*``:

    * the main action respects :samp:`{<model_name>}_action`.
    * Secondary actions are suffixed with :samp:`_{<detail>}`, where *detail* is a
    lowercase string briefly explaining the action. This is used only if
    multiple actions are declared for the model.
* Window Actions ``<act_window>|ir.actions.act_window``:

    Suffix the action name by the specific view information
    like :samp:`{<model_name>}_action_view_{<view_type>}`.
* Groups ``res.groups``:

    :samp:`{<module_name>}_group_{<group_name>}` where *group_name*
    is the name of the group, generally 'user', 'manager', ...
* Rules ``ir.rule``:

    :samp:`{<model_name>}_rule_{<concerned_group>}` where
    *concerned_group* is the short name of the concerned group ('user'
    for the 'model_name_group_user', 'public' for public user, 'company'
    for multi-company rules, ...).

For views, the `name` should be identical to xml id with dots replacing underscores.
For the other technical models, the name of the record should be detailed
to explain their role/use/target ...

.. note::

    If an action or a view is targeting specific user groups (e.g. showing some feature only to managers),
    an additionnal suffix can be useful to clearly highlight this information.

    E.g. ``product_template_view_form_sale_manager``

.. code-block:: xml

    <!-- views/<model_name>_views.xml -->
    <odoo>
        <record id="model_name_view_form" model="ir.ui.view">
            <field name="name">model.name.view.form</field>
            ...
        </record>

        <record id="model_name_view_kanban" model="ir.ui.view">
            <field name="name">model.name.view.kanban</field>
            ...
        </record>

        <!-- actions -->
        <record id="model_name_action" model="ir.act.window">
            <field name="name">Model Main Action</field>
            ...
        </record>

        <record id="model_name_action_child_list" model="ir.actions.act_window">
            <field name="name">Model Access Children</field>
        </record>
    </odoo>

.. code-block:: XML

    <!-- views/<module>_menus.xml -->
    <odoo>
        <menuitem id="module_name_menu_root"
            name="Application Name"
            web_icon="application,static/description/icon.png"
            sequence="5"/>

        <menuitem id="model_name_menu"
            name="Model Sub Menu"
            sequence="1"/>

        <menuitem id="model_name_menu_action"
            name="Model Sub Menu Action"
            parent="module_name.model_name_menu"
            action="model_name_action"
            sequence="10"/>
    </odoo>

.. code-block:: XML

    <!-- security/<module>_security.xml -->
    <odoo>
        <record id="module_name_group_user" model="res.groups">
            ...
        </record>

        <data noupdate="1">
            <!-- security rules should be specified as noupdate
                to avoid breaking customizations on module update -->
            <record id="model_name_rule_public" model="ir.rule">
                ...
            </record>

            <record id="model_name_rule_company" model="ir.rule">
                ...
            </record>
        </data>
    </odoo>

Inheriting XML
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Xml Ids of inheriting views should use the same ID as the original record.
It helps finding all inheritance at a glance. As final Xml Ids are prefixed
by the module that creates them there is no overlap.

Naming should contain an ``.inherit.{details}`` suffix to ease understanding
the override purpose when looking at its name.

.. code-block:: xml

    <record id="model_view_form" model="ir.ui.view">
        <field name="name">model.view.form.inherit.module2</field>
        <field name="inherit_id" ref="module1.model_view_form"/>
        ...
    </record>

New primary views do not require the inherit suffix as those are new records
based upon the first one.

.. code-block:: xml

    <record id="module2.model_view_form" model="ir.ui.view">
        <field name="name">model.view.form.module2</field>
        <field name="inherit_id" ref="module1.model_view_form"/>
        <field name="mode">primary</field>
        ...
    </record>

File ordering
-------------

.. todo:: in manifest: data (security, other data, assets, views, menus.xml)

.. todo:: guidelines for ir_model_access.csv ? security.xml? assets.xml ?

Views
~~~~~

Ideally, one views file by model: project_views.xml, task_views.xml, product_views, ...

#. Views

    #. search
    #. form
    #. kanban
    #. tree
    #. pivot
    #. graph
    #. gantt
    #. cohort
    #. activity
    #. map
    #. QWeb

#. Actions
#. Link actions (``ir.actions.act_url``)
#. Report actions (``ir.actions.report``)

Menus
~~~~~

.. todo:: in master update menuitems example to show recursive menuitems.

For application modules, menuitems should be defined in a separate file (and ordered hierarchically) to have a clear app organisation.
In this case, the ``<module>_menus.xml`` file should be the last specified in the ``__manifest__.py`` ``data`` imports
For generic modules (e.g. bridges), menuitems, if not many in number, can be defined after their respective actions/views.

.. _reference/guidelines/python:

Python
======

Linting
-------

Using a linter (e.g. Flake8) can help show syntax and semantic warnings or errors. Odoo
source code tries to respect Python PEP8 standard, but some of them can be ignored.

- E501: line too long

.. note:: A good max line length standard would be **99** characters for us,
            but not mandatory.

- E301: expected 1 blank line, found 0
- E302: expected 2 blank lines, found 1

Idiomatics of Programming (Python)
----------------------------------

- Always favor *readability* over *conciseness* or using the language features or idioms.
- Use meaningful variable/class/method names
- Think about :ref:`*performance* <reference/guidelines/perf>`
    and :ref:`*security* <reference/security/pitfalls>` all along the development process.
- As a good developer, document your code (docstring on key methods, simple
    comments for tricky part of code)
- Know your builtins : You should at least have a basic understanding of
    the `Python builtins <https://docs.python.org/library/functions.html>`_.
- Learn list/dict comprehensions : Use list comprehension, dict comprehension, and
    basic manipulation using ``map``, ``filter``, ``sum``, ... They make the code
    easier to read.
- Don't hesitate to refresh your `knowledge <https://learnxinyminutes.com/docs/python3/>`_ or
    to get more familiar with `Python <https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/>`_

Programming in Odoo
-------------------

- Avoid to create generators and decorators: only use the ones provided by
    the Odoo API.
- As in python, use ``filtered``, ``mapped``, ``sorted``, ... :ref:`ORM <reference/orm>` methods to
    ease code reading and performance.
- Don't reinvent the wheel: use or extend existing functionalities when you need them.
    Use :ref:`Odoo Mixins <reference/mixins>` to integrate interesting functionalities easily.
- Note that empty recordset are falsy

.. code-block:: python

    def do_something(self):
        if not self:
            return
        ...

.. warning::

    Do not forget to read the :ref:`Security Pitfalls <reference/security/pitfalls>`
    section as well to write secure code.

Make your method work in batch
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When adding a function, make sure it can process multiple records:

* by iterating on self to treat each record.
* by using adapted methods to treat all records together.

This is the basis for a lot of performance improvements, as it allows batching low level operations
of the ORM, speeding up values/records processing (e.g. CRUD calls triggering database queries).

.. code-block:: python

    def my_method(self):
        for record in self:
            record.do_cool_stuff()

    def _get_total(self):
        return sum(self.mapped('total'))

    def _confirm(self):
        return self.write({'state': 'confirmed'})

.. note::

    The previous examples also work fine when self is an empty recordset.
    Depending on the objective of a method, it's always better to consider self as a potentially empty record,
    to ensure the stability of your code.

    The majority of the ORM methods works with 0, 1 or more records::

        # won't crash even if filtered returns an empty recordset
        self.filtered('wrong_state').unlink()

.. note::

    If a method can only be called with a unique record, it can be easily enforced
    with :meth:`~odoo.models.Model.ensure_one`.

    .. code-block:: python

        def action_open_form(self):
            self.ensure_one() # === assert(len(self) == 1)
            ...

Propagate the context
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Odoo operations are done in a given environment, holding the database cursor, the user id
and the context.  The context may contain "global" variables, such as the language, the timezone,
the company(ies) in which the user is logged, and any other information specified.

The context is a ``frozendict`` that cannot be modified. To call a method with
a different context, the :meth:`~odoo.models.Model.with_context` method should be used:

.. code-block:: python

    # Replace the current context --> Potential loss of information
    # Do not use unless that's really what you want !
    records.with_context(new_context).do_stuff() # all the context is replaced

    # Update the context content --> Safe
    # additionnal_context values override native context ones
    records.with_context(**additionnal_context).do_other_stuff()

.. warning::

    Passing parameters in context can have dangerous side-effects.

    Since the values are propagated automatically, some unexpected behavior may appear.
    Calling :meth:`~odoo.models.Model.create` method of a model with *default_my_field* key in context
    will set the default value of *my_field* for the concerned model if not already specified.
    But if during this creation, other objects (such as sale.order.line, on sale.order creation)
    having a field name *my_field* are created, their default value will be set too.

If you need to create a key context influencing the behavior of some object,
choose a good name, and eventually prefix it by the name of the module to
isolate its impact. A good example are the keys of ``mail`` module :
*mail_create_nosubscribe*, *mail_notrack*, *mail_notify_user_signature*, ...

Think extendable
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Functions and methods should not contain too much logic: having a lot of small
and simple methods is more advisable than having few large and complex methods.
A good rule of thumb is to split a method as soon as it has more than one
responsibility.

.. seealso:: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_responsibility_principle

Hardcoding a business logic in a method should be avoided as it prevents an easy extension by a submodule.

.. code-block:: python

    # do not do this
    # modifying the domain or criteria implies overriding whole method
    def action(self):
        ...  # long method
        partners = self.env['res.partner'].search(complex_domain)
        emails = partners.filtered(lambda r: arbitrary_criteria).mapped('email')

    # better but do not do this either
    # modifying the logic forces to duplicate some parts of the code
    def action(self):
        ...
        partners = self._get_partners()
        emails = partners._get_emails()

    # better
    # minimum override
    def action(self):
        ...
        partners = self.env['res.partner'].search(self._get_partner_domain())
        emails = partners.filtered(lambda r: r._filter_partners()).mapped('email')

The above code is over extendable for the sake of example but the readability
must be taken into account and a tradeoff must be made.

Also, name your functions accordingly: small and properly named functions are
the starting point of readable/maintainable code and tighter documentation.

This recommendation is also relevant for classes, files, modules and packages.

Never commit the transaction
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The Odoo framework is in charge of providing the transactional context for
all RPC calls. The principle is that a new database cursor is opened at the
beginning of each RPC call, and committed when the call has returned, just
before transmitting the answer to the RPC client, approximately like this:

.. code-block:: python

    def execute(self, db_name, uid, obj, method, *args, **kw):
        db, pool = pooler.get_db_and_pool(db_name)
        # create transaction cursor
        cr = db.cursor()
        try:
            res = pool.execute_cr(cr, uid, obj, method, *args, **kw)
            cr.commit() # all good, we commit
        except Exception:
            cr.rollback() # error, rollback everything atomically
            raise
        finally:
            cr.close() # always close cursor opened manually
        return res

If any error occurs during the execution of the RPC call, the transaction is
rolled back atomically, preserving the state of the system.

Similarly, the system also provides a dedicated transaction during the execution
of tests suites, so it can be rolled back or not depending on the server
startup options.

The consequence is that if you manually call ``cr.commit()`` anywhere there is
a very high chance that you will break the system in various ways, because you
will cause partial commits, and thus partial and unclean rollbacks, causing
among others:

#. inconsistent business data, usually data loss
#. workflow desynchronization, documents stuck permanently
#. tests that can't be rolled back cleanly, and will start polluting the
    database, and triggering errors (this is true even if no error occurs
    during the transaction)

Here is the very simple rule:
    You should **NEVER** call ``cr.commit()`` yourself, **UNLESS** you have
    created your own database cursor explicitly! And the situations where you
    need to do that are exceptional!

    And by the way if you did create your own cursor, then you need to handle
    error cases and proper rollback, as well as properly close the cursor when
    you're done with it.

And contrary to popular belief, you do not even need to call ``cr.commit()``
in the following situations:

- in the :meth:`~odoo.models.model._auto_init` method of an *models.Model* object:
    this is taken care of by the addons initialization method,
    or by the ORM transaction when creating custom models
- in reports: the ``commit()`` is handled by the framework too, so you can
    update the database even from within a report.
- within *models.Transient* methods: these methods are called exactly like
    regular *models.Model* ones, within a transaction and with the corresponding
    ``cr.commit()/rollback()`` at the end.
- etc. (see general rule above if you have in doubt!)

.. warning::

    All ``cr.commit()`` calls outside of the server framework from now on must
    have an **explicit comment** explaining why they are absolutely necessary, why
    they are indeed correct, and why they do not break the transactions. Otherwise
    they can and will be removed !

.. _reference/guidelines/perf:

Performance
-----------

#. Avoid unnecessary operations
#. Batch & factorize operations
#. Use the right tool for the right operation.
    Know Python & the ORM behavior/abilities

Avoid unnecessary operations
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Globally, even outside Odoo, the easiest performance improvement is to avoid operations when possible.
We should always consider duplicated checks, operations in loop that can be moved outside, ...

For Odoo code, the best way to avoid useless operations is to know the behavior of the main ORM methods !

* :meth:`~odoo.models.Model.filtered` returns a new recordset, subset or equal to the current one.

Note that it goes through the recordset to return a new filtered recordset.
Unless you will do batch operations on the new recordset, in which case the filtered may be useful,
it is unnecessary to use :meth:`~odoo.models.Model.filtered` (and browse the recordset twice).

.. code-block:: python3

    # ~2 walkthrough of self
    for rec in self.filtered(lambda r: r.state == 'open'):
        rec.do_something()

    # one walkthrough:
    for rec in self:
        if rec.state == 'open':
        rec.do_something()

    # If do_something is optimized for batch recordset operations,
    # Then the filtered can be useful.
    self.filtered(lambda r: r.state == 'open').do_something()

* :meth:`~odoo.api.Environment.ref()` returns the reference record after verifying it still exists!

For that verification, ref always calls :meth:`~odoo.models.Model.exists()` which makes one SQL query
(``SELECT id FROM 'model' WHERE id IN ('id')``).

.. code-block:: python3

    # len(self) ref queries
    for rec in self:
        if rec.uom_id == rec.env.ref('uom.uom_day'):
        rec.in_day_uom = True

    # one ref query
    day_uom = self.env.ref('uom.uom_day')
    for rec in self:
        if rec.uom_id == day_uom:
        rec.in_day_uom = True

* :meth:`~odoo.models.Model.create()` supports batch records creation.

Depending on the model specification, creating records in batch can be up to 10 times faster !
When you need to create multiple records of the same model, please call :meth:`~odoo.models.Model.create()`
with the list of record values (dictionaries).

...

.. warning:: When you override existing ORM methods, know and follow their original API.

    * :meth:`~odoo.models.Model.create()` is by default implemented to support batch creation of records.
        If your overriden method doesn't support batch records creation (:meth:`~odoo.api.model_create_multi()`),
        your model creation may be consequently slower when creating multiple records together.

        Furthermore, note that the values may be empty and the method shouldn't crash (same for :meth:`~odoo.models.Model.write()`)!

    * :meth:`~odoo.models.Model.default_get()` receives a list of requested fields.
        There is no need to specify any value if not requested, operations can sometimes be avoided.

    ...

Database interactions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

One of the main performance bottlenecks lies in the database interactions.  Fetching
data in database can be quite slow, depending on the queries complexity.

Database query counts are not strictly a good performance indicator, as using more queries
can be sometimes more efficient, but it's still a good starting point to investigate performance issues.

SQL analysis can highlight:

* overly wide search domains (fetching too much data)
* duplicated queries (same searches, :meth:`~odoo.api.Environment.ref()` calls, ...)
* unexpected operations (while investigating the source of unexpected queries)

You will probably discover a lot of ORM specificities and improve your knowledge of Odoo.

.. note::

    The :option:`--log-sql <odoo-bin --log-sql>` option can be used to display the SQL queries
    executed.

Furthermore, the SQL level has the advantage of being more consistent.
Time based tests have proven multiple times to be quite indeterministic, depending on configuration,
other operations, ...
Query count based tests are way more deterministic, and therefore a good testing point to reduce
and/or catch performance reductions due to new SQL queries, highlighting low level changes sometimes
forgotten during the development process.

.. note::

    The :meth:`~odoo.tests.common.BaseCase.assertQueryCount()` method can be used to enforce
    a maximum number of SQL queries done in a given context::

        with self.assertQueryCount(4):
            self.env[model].do_something()

Reduce/Simplify queries as much as possible:

* Batch database requests (:meth:`~odoo.models.Model.search`, ...):

    * Use the right domain
    * Use the right ORM methods (:meth:`~odoo.models.Model.search_count`, :meth:`~odoo.models.Model.read_group`, ...)

.. code-block:: python3

    # very bad: up to len(self) queries
    for record in self:
        if record.env['model'].search([('id', '=', record.id)]):
        return True
    return False

    # better: one query
    if self.env['model'].search([('id', 'in', self.ids)]):
        return True
    return False

    # even better: read and browse only one id
    # NOTE: returning first id found is faster than using a search_count
    if self.env['model'].search([('id', 'in', self.ids)], limit=1):
        return True
    return False

* Only load what you really need:

    * a `limit` can be given for :meth:`~odoo.models.Model.search` calls
    * Read specific fields when you don't need all fields values (:meth:`~odoo.models.Model.read`, :meth:`~odoo.models.Model.read_group`)
    * Disable fields prefetching for targeted operations :ref:`reference/guidelines/perf/prefetch`.

* Use ORM-cached methods to avoid "useless" SQL queries.

    .. code-block:: python3

        # One query by ref call !
        # Do not use, unless you want to manage
        # the case where the record doesn't exist anymore.
        record = self.env.ref(xml_id)
        record_id = record.id

        # Better, use the cache
        model, id = self.env['ir.model.data'].xmlid_to_res_model_res_id(xml_id)
        record = self.env[model].browse(id)
        record_id = record.id

        # if you only need the id:
        record_id = self.env['ir.model.data'].xmlid_to_res_id(xml_id)

    .. code-block:: python3

        model = self.env['ir.model'].search([('name', '=', name)], limit=1)
        model_id = model.id

        # better
        model = self.env['ir.model']._get(name)

        # better (id)
        model_id = self.env['ir.model']._get_id(name)

SQL processing
''''''''''''''

The ORM provides multiple tools to batch/execute operations at a lower level.
Use those tools to delegate processing to the SQL level as much as possible.

.. code-block:: python3

    # bad: loading & browsing all found ids for nothing
    for record in self:
        record.model_count = len(self.env['model'].search([('rec_id', '=', record.id)]))

    # better, but still wrong : len(self) queries
    for record in self:
        record.model_count = self.env['model'].search_count([('rec_id', '=', record.id)])

    # best
    data = self.env['model'].read_group([('rec_id', 'in', self.ids)], ['rec_id'], ['rec_id'])
    mapped_data = dict([(d['rec_id'][0], d['rec_id_count']) for d in data])
    for record in self:
        record.model_count = mapped_data.get(record.id, 0)

Prefer SQL constraints to Python constraints:

#. SQL constraints are strictly enforced, whereas python constraints can be bypassed
    by SQL queries and old module data (in case of updates) could be wrong.
#. When creating records, SQL constraints are evaluated earlier, at INSERT, whereas
    the verification of Python constraints is done later, after the SQL INSERT's.

SQL constraints are more efficient, and will raise & rollback earlier in the creation process.
Python constraints should be used for more detailed/targeted explanation, and/or when the
constraint cannot be applied at the SQL level.

.. code-block:: python3

    # less efficient
    @api.constrains('begin_date', 'end_date')
    def _check_period(self):
        for record in self:
            if record.begin_date > end_date:
            raise UserError(_("Beginning date must be earlier than ending date."))

    # good: earlier and stricter check:
    _sql_constraints = [
        ('valid_period',
        "CHECK(begin_date < end_date)",
        "Beginning date must be earlier than ending date"),
    ]

Use the content in cache
''''''''''''''''''''''''

When the information is already available, do not request it again from database

.. code-block:: python3

    # probably bad, you have the records already in cache, no need to go through the database
    def action_validate(self):
        self.env.search([('validated', '=', False), ('id', 'in', self.ids)]).validated = True

    # probably better: use the cached values to filter the current recordset
    def action_validate(self):
        self.filtered_domain([('validated', '=', False)]).validated = True

.. _reference/guidelines/perf/prefetch:

Prefetch
~~~~~~~~

By default, the ORM prefetches all the records fields when reading any field on a recordset.
It considers that when we're working on a record, the value of multiple fields will probably be needed.

If you're developing a costly operation of some sort (e.g. working on big recordsets), or even targeted operations
(for which you do not need the values of all the fields, especially on big models), you may want to disable/avoid the prefetch.

Let's consider a basic case where you only need one or more fields on a recordset.

.. code-block:: python3

    for record in self:
    if record.fieldA:
        record.do_something()
    else:
        record.do_something_else()

In the previous code, when accessing ``fieldA`` on the first operation, the ORM will prefetch all stored model fields
for the records in self.  If ``self`` is huge and/or the model has a lot of fields, the database query can be quite slow.
There are 2 main ways to avoid prefetching all the fields in this case:

* Disabling the prefetch on the recordset

    The context key `prefetch_fields`, if set to ``False``, can disable the *fields* prefetch on the ORM level.

.. code-block:: python3

    self = self.with_context(prefetch_fields=False)
    for record in self:
    if record.fieldA:
        record.do_something()
    else:
        record.do_something_else()

Only ``fieldA`` will be prefetched on ``self``.

.. warning:: The context is propagated to subsequent calls !

    The execution context in *do_something*/*do_something_else* will also have the disabled prefetch.
    Do not use the ``prefetch_fields`` context key without clearly knowing the subsequent scopes.
    Disabling the prefetch can greatly hinder performance if not done wisely...

    If possible, prefer the use of :meth:`~odoo.models.Model.read()` to "disable" prefetch cleanly.

* Manually prefetching the needed field(s)

    To manually prefetch some field(s), the :meth:`~odoo.models.Model.read()` method has an useful side-effect.
    It returns the requested data, but it also fills the cache with the requested values.
    If the data for the requested field is already in cache, the ORM won't prefetch the remaining fields.

.. code-block:: python3

    self.read(['fieldA'])
    for record in self:
    if record.fieldA:
        record.do_something()
    else:
        record.do_something_else()

As ``fieldA`` is already in cache, the ORM won't prefetch the remaining fields.

Translations
------------

Odoo uses a GetText-like method named "underscore" ``_( )`` to indicate that
a static string used in the code needs to be translated at runtime using the
language of the context. This pseudo-method is accessed within your code by
importing as follows:

.. code-block:: python

    from odoo import _

A few very important rules must be followed when using it, in order for it to
work and to avoid filling the translations with useless junk.

Basically, this method should only be used for static strings written manually
in the code, it will not work to translate field values, such as Product names,
etc. This must be done instead using the translate flag on the corresponding
field.

The rule is very simple: calls to the underscore method should always be in
the form ``_('literal string')`` and nothing else:

.. code-block:: python

    # good: plain strings
    error = _('This record is locked!')

    # good: strings with formatting patterns included
    error = _('Record %s cannot be modified!') % record

    # ok too: multi-line literal strings
    error = _("""This is a bad multiline example
                    about record %s!""") % record
    error = _('Record %s cannot be modified' \
                'after being validated!') % record

    # bad: tries to translate after string formatting
    #      (pay attention to brackets!)
    # This does NOT work and messes up the translations!
    error = _('Record %s cannot be modified!' % record)

    # bad: dynamic string, string concatenation, etc are forbidden!
    # This does NOT work and messes up the translations!
    error = _("'" + que_rec['question'] + "' \n")

    # bad: field values are automatically translated by the framework
    # This is useless and will not work the way you think:
    error = _("Product %s is out of stock!") % _(product.name)
    # and the following will of course not work as already explained:
    error = _("Product %s is out of stock!" % product.name)

    # bad: field values are automatically translated by the framework
    # This is useless and will not work the way you think:
    error = _("Product %s is not available!") % _(product.name)
    # and the following will of course not work as already explained:
    error = _("Product %s is not available!" % product.name)

    # Instead you can do the following and everything will be translated,
    # including the product name if its field definition has the
    # translate flag properly set:
    error = _("Product %s is not available!") % product.name


Also, keep in mind that translators will have to work with the literal values
that are passed to the underscore function, so please try to make them easy to
understand and keep spurious characters and formatting to a minimum. Translators
must be aware that formatting patterns such as %s or %d, newlines, etc. need
to be preserved, but it's important to use these in a sensible and obvious manner:

.. code-block:: python

    # Bad: makes the translations hard to work with
    error = "'" + question + _("' \nPlease enter an integer value ")

    # Better (pay attention to position of the brackets too!)
    error = _("Answer to question %s is not valid.\n" \
                "Please enter an integer value.") % question

In general in Odoo, when manipulating strings, prefer ``%`` over ``.format()``
(when only one variable to replace in a string), and prefer ``%(varname)`` instead
of position (when multiple variables have to be replaced). This makes the
translation easier for the community translators.


Conventions and Symbols
-----------------------

Naming
~~~~~~

Model & Class
'''''''''''''

- Model name (using the dot notation, prefixed by the module name):

    - When defining an Odoo :class:`~odoo.models.Model`: use singular form of the name (*res.partner*
    and *sale.order* instead of *res.partnerS* and *saleS.orderS*)
    - When defining an Odoo :class:`~odoo.models.TransientModel` (wizard): use ``<related_base_model>.<action>``
    where *related_base_model* is the base model (defined in *models/*) related
    to the transient, and *action* is the short name of what the transient do. Avoid the *wizard* word.
    For instance : ``account.invoice.make``, ``project.task.delegate.batch``, ...
    - When defining *report* model (SQL views e.i.): use
    ``<related_base_model>.report.<action>``, based on the Transient convention.

- Odoo Python Class : use camelcase (Object-oriented style).

.. code-block:: python

    class AccountInvoice(models.Model):
        _name = "account.invoice"

        ...

Fields
''''''

- :class:`~odoo.fields.One2many` and :class:`~odoo.fields.Many2many` fields should always have *_ids* as suffix (example: sale_order_line_ids)
- :class:`~odoo.fields.Many2one` fields should have *_id* as suffix (example: partner_id, user_id, ...)

.. note::

    Some field names have specific meaning in Odoo, know their meaning/use before using/overriding those.

    * The :ref:`automatic fields (id, create_date, write_date, ...)<reference/fields/automatic>` are automatically created
        on a given model unless it is specified as `_auto = False`.
    * Some :ref:`reserved field names (state, parent_id, ...)<reference/fields/reserved>` provides specific abilities/behavior.

Methods
'''''''

- Method conventions & patterns:

    - Compute method: ``_compute_<field_name>``
    - Search method: ``_search_<field_name>``
    - Default method: ``_default_<field_name>``
    - Selection method: ``_selection_<field_name>``
    - Onchange method: ``_onchange_<field_name>``
    - Constraint method: ``_check_<constraint_name>``
    - Action method: an object action method is prefixed with ``action_``.
    If it can only be called on one record, add ``self.ensure_one()``
    at the beginning of the method.

Variables
'''''''''

- Variable name :

    - Use camelcase for model variable (empty model recordsets).
    - Use underscore lowercase notation for common variable.
    - Suffix your variable name with *_id* (*_ids*) if it contains a record id (list of ids).
    Don't use ``partner_id``(``partner_ids``) for a res.partner recordset.

.. code-block:: python

    Partner = self.env['res.partner']
    partner = partner.browse(id)
    partners = Partner.browse(ids)
    partner_id = partners[0].id
    partner_ids = partners.ids

Imports
'''''''

The imports are ordered as:

#. External libraries (one per line sorted and split in python stdlib)
#. Imports of ``odoo``
#. Imports from Odoo modules (rarely, and only if necessary)

Inside these 3 groups, the imported lines are alphabetically sorted.

Model attributes
''''''''''''''''

In a :class:`~odoo.models.Model`, the attribute order should be:

#. Private attributes (``_name``, ``_description``, ``_inherit``, ...)
#. Default methods and :meth:`~odoo.models.Model.default_get`
#. :class:`Fields <~odoo.fields.Field>` declarations:

    * Main fields first (e.g. required fields)
    * Computed/Related fields should be defined after their dependencies.
#. SQL constraints, defined through the ``_sql_constraints`` attribute.
#. :ref:`Compute<reference/fields/compute>`, inverse and search methods in the same order as field declaration
#. Selection method (methods used to return computed values for selection fields)
#. Constrains methods (:meth:`@api.constrains<odoo.api.constrains>`) and onchange methods (:meth:`@api.onchange<odoo.api.onchange>`)
#. CRUD methods (ORM overrides: :meth:`~odoo.models.Model.create`, :meth:`~odoo.models.Model.unlink`, :meth:`~odoo.models.Model.write`, ...)
#. Action methods
#. And finally, other business methods.

Static files organization
--------------------------

Odoo addons have some conventions on how to structure various files. We explain
here in more details how web assets are supposed to be organized.

The first thing to know is that the Odoo server will serve (statically) all files
located in a *static/* folder, but prefixed with the addon name. So, for example,
if a file is located in *addons/web/static/src/js/some_file.js*, then it will be
statically available at the url *your-odoo-server.com/web/static/src/js/some_file.js*

The convention is to organize the code according to the following structure:

- *static*: all static files in general

    - *static/lib*: this is the place where js libs should be located, in a sub folder.
    So, for example, all files from the *jquery* library are in *addons/web/static/lib/jquery*
    - *static/src*: the generic static source code folder

    - *static/src/css*: all css files
    - *static/src/fonts*
    - *static/src/img*
    - *static/src/js*

        - *static/src/js/tours*: end user tour files (tutorials, not tests)

    - *static/src/scss*: scss files
    - *static/src/xml*: all qweb templates that will be rendered in JS

    - *static/tests*: this is where we put all test related files.

    - *static/tests/tours*: this is where we put all tour test files (not tutorials).

Javascript coding guidelines
----------------------------

- ``use strict;`` is recommended for all javascript files
- Use a linter (jshint, ...)
- Never add minified Javascript Libraries
- Use camelcase for class declaration

More precise JS guidelines are detailed in the `github wiki  <https://github.com/odoo/odoo/wiki/Javascript-coding-guidelines>`_.
You may also have a look at existing API in Javascript by looking Javascript
References.

CSS coding guidelines
---------------------

- Prefix all your classes with *o_<module_name>* where *module_name* is the
    technical name of the module ('sale', 'im_chat', ...) or the main route
    reserved by the module (for website module mainly, i.e. : 'o_forum' for
    *website_forum* module). The only exception for this rule is the
    webclient: it simply uses *o_* prefix.
- Avoid using *id* tag
- Use Bootstrap native classes
- Use underscore lowercase notation to name class

Configure your git
------------------

Based on ancestral experience and oral tradition, the following things go a long
way towards making your commits more helpful:

- Be sure to define both the user.email and user.name in your local git config

    .. code-block:: text

        git config --global <var> <value>

- Be sure to add your full name to your Github profile here. Please feel fancy
    and add your team, avatar, your favorite quote, and whatnot ;-)

Commit message structure
------------------------

Commit message has four parts: tag, module, short description and full
description. Try to follow the preferred structure for your commit messages

.. code-block:: text

    [TAG] module: describe your change in a short sentence (ideally < 50 chars)

    Long version of the change description, including the rationale for the change,
    or a summary of the feature being introduced.

    Please spend a lot more time describing WHY the change is being done rather
    than WHAT is being changed. This is usually easy to grasp by actually reading
    the diff. WHAT should be explained only if there are technical choices
    or decision involved. In that case explain WHY this decision was taken.

    End the message with references, such as task or bug numbers, PR numbers, and
    OPW tickets, following the suggested format:
    task-123 (related to task)
    Fixes #123  (close related issue on Github)
    Closes #123  (close related PR on Github)
    opw-123 (related to ticket)

Tag and module name
-------------------

Tags are used to prefix your commit. They should be one of the following

- **[FIX]** for bug fixes: mostly used in stable version but also valid if you
    are fixing a recent bug in development version;
- **[REF]** for refactoring: when a feature is heavily rewritten;
- **[ADD]** for adding new modules;
- **[REM]** for removing resources: removing dead code, removing views,
    removing modules, ...;
- **[REV]** for reverting commits: if a commit causes issues or is not wanted
    reverting it is done using this tag;
- **[MOV]** for moving files: use git move and do not change content of moved file
    otherwise Git may loose track and history of the file; also used when moving
    code from one file to another;
- **[REL]** for release commits: new major or minor stable versions;
- **[IMP]** for improvements: most of the changes done in development version
    are incremental improvements not related to another tag;
- **[MERGE]** for merge commits: used in forward port of bug fixes but also as
    main commit for feature involving several separated commits;
- **[CLA]** for signing the Odoo Individual Contributor License;
- **[I18N]** for changes in translation files;

After tag comes the modified module name. Use the technical name as functional
name may change with time. If several modules are modified, list them or use
various to tell it is cross-modules. Unless really required or easier avoid
modifying code across several modules in the same commit. Understanding module
history may become difficult.

Commit message header
---------------------

After tag and module name comes a meaningful commit message header. It should be
self explanatory and include the reason behind the change. Do not use single words
like "bugfix" or "improvements". Try to limit the header length to about 50 characters
for readability.

Commit message header should make a valid sentence once concatenated with
``if applied, this commit will <header>``. For example ``[IMP] base: prevent to
archive users linked to active partners`` is correct as it makes a valid sentence
``if applied, this commit will prevent users to archive...``.

Commit message full description
-------------------------------

In the message description specify the part of the code impacted by your changes
(module name, lib, transversal object, ...) and a description of the changes.

First explain WHY you are modifying code. What is important if someone goes back
to your commit in about 4 decades (or 3 days) is why you did it. It is the
purpose of the change.

What you did can be found in the commit itself. If there was some technical choices
involved it is a good idea to explain it also in the commit message after the why.
For Odoo R&D developers "PO team asked me to do it" is not a valid why, by the way.

Please avoid commits which simultaneously impact multiple modules. Try to split
into different commits where impacted modules are different. It will be helpful
if we need to revert changes in a given module separately.

Don't hesitate to be a bit verbose. Most people will only see your commit message
and judge everything you did in your life just based on those few sentences.
No pressure at all.

**You spend several hours, days or weeks working on meaningful features. Take
some time to calm down and write clear and understandable commit messages.**

If you are an Odoo R&D developer the WHY should be the purpose of the task you
are working on. Full specifications make the core of the commit message.
**If you are working on a task that lacks purpose and specifications please
consider making them clear before continuing.**

Finally here are some examples of correct commit messages :

.. code-block:: text

    [REF] models: use `parent_path` to implement parent_store

    This replaces the former modified preorder tree traversal (MPTT) with the
    fields `parent_left`/`parent_right`[...]

    [FIX] account: remove frenglish

    [...]

    Closes #22793
    Fixes #22769

    [FIX] website: remove unused alert div, fixes look of input-group-btn

    Bootstrap's CSS depends on the input-group-btn
    element being the first/last child of its parent.
    This was not the case because of the invisible
    and useless alert.

.. note:: Use the long description to explain the *why* not the
            *what*, the *what* can be seen in the diff
