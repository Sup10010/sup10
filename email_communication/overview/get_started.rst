Communication is the process of sending and receiving messages through verbal or nonverbal means. It includes oral communications, writing and graphical representations and many others. 
More simply, communication is designating "the creation and exchange of meaning."

In any communication there is a sender and a receiver, a message, and interpretations of meaning on both ends

The emailing system is the main communication in Odoo between a seller and his customer. 
They are displayed in the chatter, usually coming from a template or a direct message

The mailing is the main source of communication between your database and your users, ensuring that they receive your email and you are able to receive their reply is crucial for your company.

The impossibility to communicate properly will result on the lose of trust of your customers toward you.

It’s one of the first implementations that was made, due to the necessity of the tool. As first an early developed tool, it also has its own limitations. All that his coming after has been implemented in regard to what was done before. In the same way, doing changes here are quite hard to do and we need to be sure it won’t break anything.

  

There is plenty of existing tools online that will help you ensuring that you will be successful on this:
